# Snapshot
## Description

Snapshot is a python app to monitor your system/server. 
It's a tool that creates snapshots of the systemâ€™s state, at regular intervals that you can configure (default to 20 in total, every 30 seconds), and outputs to a json-file and the console.

## Motivation

This project is a solution presented to the shapshot-util problem, in the EPAM practice-lab for python
